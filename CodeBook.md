### Coursera Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

* yTest           - input dataframe from test/y_test.txt  
* xTest           - input dataframe from test/X_test.txt  
* subjectTest     - input dataframe from test/subject_test.txt  
  
* yTrain          - input dataframe from train/y_train.txt  
* xTrain          - input dataframe from train/X_train.txt  
* subjectTrain    - input dataframe from train/subject_train.txt  

* activityLabels  - input dataframe from activity_labels.txt  
* features        - input dataframe from features.txt  
  
* testData - copy of xTest  
* trainData - copy of xTrain  

* finalData       - row bind the test and training data sets containing the measurement data and assign to finalData  
* names(finalData)    - set the variable names for the finalData columns  

* meanStdData     - extract the mean and std columns and assign to meanstdData  
* testActivitySubject     - combine the activity and subject columns from test data  
* trainActivitySubject    - combine the activity and subject columns from training data  
* activitySubject     - combine the rows from testActivitySubject and trainActivitySubject  
* colnames(activitySubject)   - set the variable names for activitySubject columns  
  
* cleanData       - add the activity and subject columns to meanStdData  
* cleanData$activity  - use factor() to change the activity column from number to their equivalent activity names.  
                      convert the activity column to character type and rename the levels to activity names  
                      using the second column from activityLabels data frame.  

* library(reshape2)   - use the melt, dcast functions to group the data  
* meltClean   - use melt() to reshape the data frame, using activity and subject as id variables.  
* finalTidyData   - use dcast() to group by both subject and activity and calculate mean for each variable which has the  
                  measurements for mean and std.  
                  
* write.table()   - write the final tidy data to a file finalTidyData.txt.  
  
  
* projectTidyData()   - This function contains all the code, and is called at the end of the script.
