GettingAndCleaningData_Project
==============================

The project contains the following files:

* run_analysis.R  -  this R script contains the code to get data from a directory, clean it, transform it into a desired form, and finally output the tidy data to a file.

* CodeBook.md     -  describes the variables and functions used in the R script, and the transformations performed to get the desired output.
